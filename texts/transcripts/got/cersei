 and you never worry about anything. when we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as casterly rock. one hundred foot drop into the water. and you were never afraid. what if jon arryn told someone? my husband. you should be the hand of the king. we’ve been riding for a month, my love. surely the dead can wait. where is our brother? go find the little beast. yes. lovely country. hello, little dove. but you are a beauty. how old are you? you’re tall. still growing? and have you bled yet? and your dress. did you make it? such talent. you must make something for me. your daughter will do well in the capital. such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever. stop. stop. he saw us. he saw us! you command the city watch, do you not, lord slynt? and are you not a lord at my command? then do your job. shut the gates to the peasants. they belong in the field, not our capital. what are you doing here? what are you doing here? this is the small council. our father is hand of the king. out! all of you out. (the small council members all get up and leave until it is only cersei and tyrion. cersei stands up and approaches tyrion). i would like to know how you tricked father into this. i've done nothing. i tried to stop it. robb stark is a child. what do you know about warfare? joffrey is king. you are here to advise him. how? one. arya, little animal, she disappeared. lord baelish. i wonder if i might ask you for a favor. ned stark's youngest daughter arya... we can't seem to locate her. and yet my friends in the north report no sign of her. if we choose to negotiate with the starks, the girl has some value. whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about lannisters and debts. a mockingbird. (points to a pin on baelish’s shirt). you created your own sigil, didn't you? appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing. i heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. he loved the eldest daughter. sadly, she had eyes for another. and which truth is that? seize him. (cersei’s guards seize baelish). cut his throat. (a guard holds a knife to baelish’s neck). stop. wait. i've changed my mind. let him go. (the guards let baelish go). step back three paces. turn around. close your eyes. (the guards do as cersei says). (to baelish) power is power. do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the stark girl for me. i would very much appreciate it. what is all this? we can't find arya stark. perhaps. but if not, we need her. they'll never give jaime back to us for sansa alone. we need to set our armies to the task of finding her. send out as many men as we can. i'm sure if you asked grandfather - his life is in danger. our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne. of course it is. no one believes this foul gossip - what are you asking? what are you doing here? i’ve done nothing. what are you asking? “from this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent kingdom of the north.” (rips up the letter). he has more spirit than his father, i'll give him that. you'll give the starks our reply, cousin? did you see my brother when you were the starks guest? if you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten. if that's everything? another king? how many is that now, five? i've lost count. perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. we have no men to spare. one trip to the wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. (walks away, followed by varys). i have every confidence the brave men of the night's watch will protect us all. lord janos slynt was commander of the city watch. you had no right to exile him. you're serving as the king's hand until father gets here. i am queen regent. ha, the people. you think i care? he did what needed to be done. (now loudly). you want to be the hand of the king? you want to rule? this is what ruling is! lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep. i don't care what you think! you've never taken it seriously. you haven't, jaime hasn't. (sits down). it's all fallen on me. you're funny. (laughs). you've always been funny. but none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? you remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death. now they're gone, for the sake of you. there's no bigger joke in the world than that. (storms out). bloody martells. you're dismissed, grand maester. not anymore. you can save him? do everything you can. come to me with anything you need. will it weaken him? very well then. i'm opening it again. i will not. i don't care. i will stay in king's landing where i belong with my son, the king. i'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. this isn't going to be one of those times. when you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the battle at blackwater, do you remember?! i was sitting on the iron throne with tommen. i was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far i was willing to go when i thought someone awful had come to take my son away. someone awful is coming to take him away. joffrey is dead. myrcella's been sold like livestock. and now you want to ship me off to highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. i will burn our house to the ground before i let that happen. i'll tell everyone the truth. you don't know, do you? you never believed it. how is that possible? what am i saying, of course it's possible. how can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? we were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. one look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would've known. everything they say is true about jaime and me. your legacy is a lie. yes you do. jaime. for my family, no. i would do things for my family you couldn't imagine. he's not. i do, so do you. you can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world- a disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. what do you decide? what do you choose? i choose you. yes. like the ones i just said to father. i told him. i told him about us. i told him i wouldn't marry loras tyrell. i told him i'm staying right here with tommen, with you. go and ask him. i don't want to talk about tywin lannister. i don't choose tywin lannister, i don't love tywin lannister. i love my brother. i love my lover. people will whisper, they'll make their jokes. let them. they're all so small i can't even see them. i only see what matters. i don't care. why not? he’ll never know we’ve been gone. you don’t need to be afraid of my father. yes. of course we should. no. they said that you were terrifying. with cat’s teeth and three eyes. you’re not terrifying. you’re boring. i know you’re a witch and you can see the future. tell me mine. this is my father’s land. my land. tell me my future or i’ll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head. i’ve been promised to the prince. when will we marry? but i will be queen? will the king and i have children? that doesn’t make sense. they will keep waiting. i want a moment alone with him. they will wait. he never wanted you to be a king’s guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body. they? they had nothing to do with it. the man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he’s the enemy. i’ve been telling you for years, you’ve been defending him for years… ...and now our father is dead. and that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. did you set him free? tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. you killed him by mistake. with stupidity. you’re a man of action, aren’t you? when it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. take a look. (gestures towards tywin) look at the consequences. here they are. he loved you more than anyone in this world. cousin lancel. i hardly recognized you. uncle, it’s quite alright. i’m sure he’ll grow out of it. whatever it is. excuse me. your wounds from the blackwater seem to have healed. what can i do for you? what could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness? i doubt you’ve ever led anyone anywhere. i don’t know what you’re talking about. the day tywin lannister’s soul needs your help… there are only two like it in the world: the one i’m wearing and the one i gave to myrcella. of course it’s a threat! our daughter’s in dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. (mocking) "it's a threat." they blame us for the death of oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that’s befallen their cursed country. i will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her! what? our daughter’s in danger, and you’re worried i’m speaking too loudly! then don’t call her your daughter. you’ve never been a father to her. and what has your caution brought? our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. our only daughter shipped off to dorne. our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from highgarden. you never made anything better. you can’t just ask prince doran to give her back! she’s promised his son. you go there with an army, it’s an act of war. oberyn mentioned the water gardens. (scoffs) you’re going to dorne? a one-handed man? alone? not him. that won't be necessary, ser meryn. i don't want to dissuade the other hunters. mistakes will be made. take the head. very good. no, uncle. clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. i'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a hand for himself. you're a good man, lord tyrell, but i don't imagine you'll have the time. in addition to being master of ships, the king has appointed you master of coin. he called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. he said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same. the king has named qyburn the new master of whisperers. the qualification of loyalty, grand maester. that's far more than the eunuch ever had. far more than many ever have. the king is very busy at this moment. he is learning. on this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf. my brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission. that is not your concern as master of war. you would abandon your king in his time of need? you look very much in love. the first days of marriage are often so blissful. she's certainly very pretty, isn't she? like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. do you think she's intelligent? i can't quite tell. not that it matters. there's nothing for me in casterly rock. (chuckles). why are we speaking of casterly rock? this is my real home now. where my family lives. i know that. i know you do, my sweet boy. don't you look lovely. marriage agrees with you. no, no. i, i can't stay. i just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything i can do for you. tommen seems quite taken with his new queen. good. good. i'm glad to hear you're happy. i'll leave you to it then. (turns to leave). there's no need for such formalities. won’t that be a lovely day. remember. anything you need. you were assaulted? what do you want from us, high septon? and where do i find this man? this high sparrow? nonsense, ser meryn. these are deeply religious people. (to a man at the bottom of some stairs). where can i find the high sparrow? a young man said i would find the high sparrow back here. where is he? why no shoes? is that why you came to king's landing? to remind everyone? (smiles). perhaps they're right. an unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the gods in this world, wouldn't you say? the high septon came to speak to me today. he doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you. (after a moment). my thoughts on the matter align with your own. the high septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. having a man like that reside in the sept eats away the faith from the inside. so now he resides in the red keep's dungeons instead. (the high sparrow looks up at her surprised). the faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. if one collapses, so does the other. we must do everything necessary to protect one another. send a raven with this message to littlefinger in the eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. (hands him the letter). how's your work coming along? you've made progress? very good. i'll leave you to it then. make sure littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word "immediately". how much can the crown afford? you're the master of coin. how do we pay them? you've already given us too much. (gets up and walks to a window). no, we must arrange better terms with the iron bank. in person. we must send an envoy to the iron bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. as the king's master of coin, i can think of no one more qualified. the king has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. (smiling). he's ordered ser meryn to personally lead your escort. safe travels, lord tyrell. (walking out). not small enough. may i offer you some wine, your holiness? the old high septon would have asked the vintage. (smiles). hmm. all over westeros we hear about septs being burned. silent sisters raped. bodies of holy men piled in the streets. perhaps the gods need a sword of their own. (hs raises an eyebrow). in the days before the targaryens, the faith militant dispensed the justice of the seven. if i explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, i have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy. an army and service to the gods themselves. and to you, of course. as the chosen representative of the seven. which is why you were chosen. (hs smiles). you and i both know how the world works. too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. the king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most. (smiles. continues after a moment). what would you say if i told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? shielded by gold and privilege. (turns around). did i arrest him? i did. and your wife has every right to criticize. (begins walking towards her desk). can't allow fanatics to arrest the queen's brother, no matter his perversions. i told you i am not holding ser loras. you're the king. i'm sure if you speak to the high sparrow, he'll release the poor boy. the faith arrested the heir to highgarden. the king’s orders. is the king to blame for ser loras’ perversion? house tyrell won’t tolerate it? i’m the insulted party, lord baelish. ser loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys. most curious. lysa arryn for instance. a sorrily repellent woman. forgive me. i know you’re still in mourning. she was neither of those things, we both know it. still, i pity her son. how fortunate that the young lord of the vale has a new father to counsel him. if war comes to westeros will the knights of the veil fight for their king? good. (cersei gets up) if there’s nothing else. that’s not possible. roose bolton is warden of the north by the grace of my father. we were fools to trust a turncloak. i will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil. patience? sansa helped murder my son, roose bolton is a traitor. winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. the weather has already begun to turn. my uncle kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse. jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. i’ve no idea when he’ll be back. forgive me lord baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man. and if you succeed? i’ll speak to the king this evening. have him issue a royal decree. and i’ll l know you’re a man of your word when i see sansa stark’s head on a spike. you must be exhausted. ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns. beg your pardon. if you apologize for that comment perhaps-- i was as shocked as anyone when the faith arrested ser loras. i have no love for these fanatics. but what can the queen mother do? i assure you our alliance with house tyrell remains-- as i said, i didn’t imprison anyone. as for your veiled threats-- the lannister-tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. do you really want to see the seven kingdoms slide back into warfare? house lannister has no rival. the high septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against loras have merit, which i’m sure they don’t. loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we’ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. good day, lady olenna. this testimony is an insult to a great house. why should the faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to highgarden? starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love. no matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control. you know as well as i do who the first casualty in that war would be. we must be strong for those we love. we cannot give in to despair. let me speak to him on your behalf. the king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic. your happiness is all i want in this world no you don’t. you can’t possibly. not until you have children of your own. i would do anything for you. anything to keep you from harm. i would burn cities to the ground. that is all that matters. you and your sister. from the moment you came into this world, my boy. my only boy. this is horrible. unacceptable. are they feeding you enough at least? i brought you this. venison. it’s quite good. i had it myself for supper only last night. we did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but i fear the faith has left reason behind. we are making every effort on your behalf. i swear to you by all the seven gods. you’re upset. you’re not thinking clearly. i’ll visit again when you’ve had a chance to calm down. i do hope you change your mind about that. i’ve been told men often go mad in the black cells below the red keep, but i suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins. yes, i’m afraid i must. my son needs me now more than ever. sleep well, sister. yes. her accommodations seem sufficient. what happens to her now? who will stand judge? will you be one of them? if one or both of them were to confess before the trial… what does the mother’s mercy entail? thank you high septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the seven. i think i may have heard at one point. i’m afraid i don’t. move. let me go immediately. look at me. look at my face. it’s the last thing you’ll see before you die. my son. let me speak to-- my face will be the last thing you see before-- the charges? all lies. i wish you’d said it sooner. any word from jaime? tell him i need to speak to him. what about my son, the king? if you can visit me then surely the king-- you need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother. i can’t stay here. confess? to the high sparrow? i won’t. i made him. i rose him up from nothing, i will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness. i’ll get out of here, you realize. before long. i can make you a wealthy woman. a lady of the court. i can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all i do is sit here imagining ways for you to die. i have sinned. i see that now. how could i have been so blind for so long. i want to be clean again. i want absolution. the crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light-- once i’ve confessed, will i be free? the mother have mercy then. i lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, i confess. lancel lannister. i was lonely and afraid. a husband of whoring every chance he got. may the gods forgive me. no. no. i do. a lie. a lie from the lips of stannis baratheon. he wants the throne, but his brother’s children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers’. the filth. there is not one shred of truth to it. i deny it. trial? i have confessed? i bow to the wisdom of your high holiness. but if i might beg for just one drop of the mother’s mercy. i haven’t seen my son… i don’t know how long it’s been. i need to see him. please. thank you. thank you. i will, i will. i swear it, day and night. am i free to go? my atonement? myrcella… do you remember the first time you saw a dead body? all i could think about when she died was what would happen to her now. every day, every night, what does mama look like now? has she started to bloat? has her skin turned black? have her lips peeled back from her teeth? i think about locking myrcella in a crypt. i think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse. i have to. i have to. it’s not right she has to suffer alone. i thought if i could make something so good, so pure...maybe i’m not a monster. no, i knew this would happen. the witch told me years ago. she promised me three children. she promised me they’d die. “and gold their shrouds.” everything she said came true. you couldn’t have stopped it. it’s prophecy. it’s fate. of course i do. you told me yourself when father died. you said we had to stay together. you said people would try to tear us apart, take what’s ours. that was a prophecy, too. i didn’t listen to you, and everything you said came true. better you’re elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons. what, then? you can’t. we should treat them without mercy and we will. but if you kill the high sparrow, you won’t leave the sept alive. and without you, this is all for nothing. stand at the head of our army where you belong, where father wanted you. show our men where their loyalties belong. show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. and take that stupid little castle back because it’s ours and because you can. it will be a trial by combat. i have the mountain. they’ve made us both stronger, all of them. they have no idea how strong we are. no idea what we’re going to do to them. we’ve always been together. we’ll always be together. we’re the only two people in the world. i heard you were leaving king’s landing. your grandson is still a prisoner. you’ll leave him rotting in a cell? you’re right. i made a terrible mistake. i carry it with me every single day. i delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. and now we must fight them together. we need each other. you love your granddaughter. i love my son. it’s the only truth i know. we must defend them. never. i’ll never leave my son. have been permitted? that’s rather a tortured way of putting it. who permitted them inside the red keep? the king is aware of their presence? his holiness the high septon is welcome to see me here in the red keep. it is a request, cousin lancel. you are asking me for something, i’m refusing. he promised me i could stay in the red keep until my trial. get out. i choose violence. please tell his high holiness he’s always welcome to visit. there’s to be a royal announcement? why wasn’t i informed? to stand by my son. and? was it just a rumor or something more? get out of my way. what are the king’s orders? you’re barring me from attending my own daughter’s funeral? i would like to speak to my son. did they put her in the red gown or the gold? good. it was always her color. i understand. i’m glad to see you. it’s all right. always. varys's little birds? the high sparrow has hundreds of faith militant surrounding him. ser gregor will can’t face them all. and he won’t have to. he’ll only have to face one. not yet. thank you for bringing it up. it’s well past time we addressed the abuses i endured. grand maester pycelle, would you sanction that statement? and seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it. what are you doing here? leave. is this a small council meeting? since i’ve missed the past several small coucil meetings, i wanted to speak to you about a few things. as have we all, unfortunately. look at me. what did they do to me? to the king’s own mother? it’s all right. it's done. it’s in the past. and of course margaery’s safety is paramount. whether i like her or not is completely unimportant. margaery is the queen. queens must command respect. kings even more so. not just for their own sake, but for everyone’s. the high sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. no respect for anything in this world. he has no use for the things of this world. he want to knock them down and replace them with what? with fantasies. with beggars in the street. with nothing. you’ve spoken with him? it would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. i am your mother. you can always trust me. the small council meeting has been postponed on the king’s orders. you once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one’s rivals. the high sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. here we are. well done to us. now the future of the seven kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. in a few days, he’ll have a trial for me. but before that, queen margaery will make her walk of atonement. yes, margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city. i agree. you hate these fanatics as much as we do. you hate what they’ve done to your son. do you want lancel back or have you given him up for good? then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
